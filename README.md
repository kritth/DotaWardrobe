# DotaWardrobe
Repository for Dota Wardrobe add-on from Dota 2 workshop

Notes:

1. This addon may take several minutes or longer to load due to massive amount of cosmetics to prepare before the game starts.
2. This addon is designed for single-player purpose. Multiplayer might not work at all (I did not test this aspect). 
3. During the loadout, it is best adviced to remove all current cosmetics for easier identification on replacing the cosmetics. 

Known issues due to restrictions: 

1. Particles that comes with the cosmetics in-game do not come after swapping the cosmetic. That being said, Arcana is not available. This can be made viable if someone will give me the list of particle that can attach to the specific hero. 
2. When swapping cosmetics that is not originally from selected hero, it is not guaranteed that it will be placed in the right place due to model's restriction, this cannot be fixed. 

Available Options:

1. Toggle on/off for cosmetic controller. 
2. Swapping current cosmetics in current tab with available cosmetics from available tab. There is also an option to show all cosmetics from all heroes as well. If you want to change back to default cosmetic, simply hit Default button. 
3. Force unit to play some basic animations in animation tab. 
4. Adjust camera distance with zoom slider bar.
5. Toggle fog of war on/off.
